<h1>Discord_Quiplash</h1>
This program facilitates a fun party game for a discord server; inspired by the jackbox game.
This program was my first big personal project. It involved utilizing the discord API to play quiplash on my friends and my discord server.
Additionally, prompts for the game are parsed from r/askOuija using the reddit API to keep prompts fresh and new.
