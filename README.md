<h1>Discord_Quiplash</h1>
This program facilitates a fun party game for a discord server; inspired by the jackbox game, Quiplash.
This program was summer personal project. It involved utilizing the discord API to play quiplash with my friends on our discord server.
Additionally, prompts for the game are parsed from r/askOuija using the reddit API to keep the game fresh and new, one drawback of the original game.
